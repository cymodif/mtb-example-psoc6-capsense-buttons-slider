## Design and Implementation

In this project, PSoC 6 MCU scans a self-capacitance (CSD) based 5-element CapSense slider, and two mutual capacitance (CSX) CapSense buttons for user input. The project uses the [CapSense Middleware](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/capsense) (see [ModusToolbox User Guide](http://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) for more details on selecting a middleware). See [AN85951 – PSoC 4 and PSoC 6 MCU CapSense Design Guide](https://www.cypress.com/an85951) for more details on CapSense features and usage. 

In this application, the state of the user LED is controlled based on user inputs provided using the CapSense buttons and slider. A PWM HAL resource is configured for controlling the brightness of the LED. Touching Button 0 turns the LED ON, and Button 1 turns the LED OFF. The brightness of the LED is set based on the touch position on the CapSense slider. 

The [ModusToolbox CapSense Configurator Tool Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxCapSenseConfig) describes step-by-step instructions on how to configure CapSense in the application. The CapSense Configurator and Tuner tools can be launched from the CSD personality in the Device Configurator tool.

The application uses an [EZI2C HAL](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/psoc6hal/html/group__group__hal__ezi2c.html) interface for communicating with the CapSense Tuner.

## Operation at Custom Power Supply Voltage

The application is configured to work with the default operating voltage of the kit.  

**Table 1. Operating Voltages Supported by the Kits**
